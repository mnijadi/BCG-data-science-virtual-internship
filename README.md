# Data Science Virtual Internship : Customer Churn Analysis & Modeling

## Introduction

This project is a part of the [BCG's Data Science virtual internship](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/Tcz8gTtprzAS4xSoK/Data-Science-Virtual-Experience-Program).  
The project is about analyzing customer churn data for an electricity and gas commpany.  
The project is divided into 4 parts:

- Hypothesis framing and solution design
- Exploratory data analysis in depth
- Feature engineering and modeling
- Business insights and recommendations

## Data

The data our client provided us with contains 2 datasets:

- `client_data.csv`: contains information about the clients
- `price_data.csv`: contains information about historical prices

## Tools

The project was done using Python 3 and the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Run the following command to install in a new environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
